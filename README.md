Project Description: Cardatabse is a solution designed for Ethiopian Customs Authority. While importing cars to Ethiopia total amount of tax payable to Customs were compiled on MS Access and distributed to customers on CD and printed copies. Clients must be present to the customs clearance office in person to inquire tax payable details for specific model. From the ECAâ€™s point of view the other problem was distributed the updated TAX information. The web based solution is designed to solve that problem by giving the user a chance to choose brand, model and manufactured year of a car then the system calculates the total tax to be paid and display tax details for the specific car s/he has chosen.
